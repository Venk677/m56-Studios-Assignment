# m56-Studios-Assignment
An assignment to assign position to player amongst other players comparing his scores to the highest scores of other players in an descending order, having in mind same score by both players leads them to be in a same position.


Please copy and paste the code to your IDE or you can also use https://repl.it/ to run the code.

The code can be executed by the command "node Assigment.js" when run on terminal.

As my proefficiency is in python and not in JS, I have tried my best to come up with a decent solution.
Thank you, looking forward for the feedback.
